# fullStackGo

This repository contains a web application that uses Okta 
for single sign on authorization, MDN bootstrap for UI/UX, 
GoLang for server side processing, and various JS libraries for
interacting with elements of the DOM. It's also leveraging an Amazon
RDS instance as a database for standard CRUD operations.

Note: This repository is currently a work in progress and will 
reflect the latter after due time.
